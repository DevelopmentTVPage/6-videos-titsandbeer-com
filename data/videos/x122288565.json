    "description": "55% quieter than a traditional blender\n\nNo need to worry about waking up the house \u2013 or the neighborhood \u2013 for that 6:00 a.m. smoothie. The Hamilton Beach\u00ae Sound Shield 950 is designed to reduce noise from the four different areas of a traditional blender. It\u2019s quiet enough to carry on your party conversation when mixing margaritas, or prepping dinner while the baby naps upstairs.\n\nA hinged, 2-piece sound shield opens and closes over the 52 oz. MultiBlend\u2122 glass jar. With 950 watts of power, 5 speeds and three programmed settings, including smoothie, you can do everything from mix salsas to puree soups. Stainless steel blades make quick work of crushing ice, and the drip-free pour spout means no more smoothie running down the side of the jar or all over your kitchen counter. The blade and jar are both dishwasher safe.",
