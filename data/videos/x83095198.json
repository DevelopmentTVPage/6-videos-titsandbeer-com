    "description": "Hunters love rituals, often rising well before the sun to prepare their minds, bodies and equipment for a day with nature and the pursuit of game.\n\nAn important part of the ritual that keeps outdoorsmen going is a cup of bold-tasting coffee. Just as hunters are passionate about their hobby, BUNN is equally passionate about making great coffeemakers that deliver a great tasting cup of coffee for every occasion.\n\nThe Speed Brew\u00ae Outdoorsman\u2122 model with its authentic Realtree camouflage design and straightforward functionality is made for the hunter. This model is the newest edition to the BUNN Speed Brew series of coffeemakers  which are the fastest 10-cup home coffeemakers in America.*  Its' reliability has been proven through rigorous quality testing and this workhorse is built to keep up with the demands of an outdoor lifestyle.\n\nThe exclusive commercial style lime-tolerant sprayhead fully saturates coffee grounds in a precise amount of time resulting in great tasting coffee that isn't bitter. And you will get the cleanest pour on the market with the exclusive Drip-Free Glass Carafe with a proprietary lid and spout design that arcs the pour of the coffee into the cup and wicks the coffee dribbles back into the carafe  \n\nThe Outdoorsman is designed and assembled in the USA, is guaranteed with a 3-year warranty, and is backed by an exceptional customer service team from the BUNN headquarters in Springfield, Illinois.\n\nAn old adage wisely states, \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\u201d BUNN Speed Brew technology has been consistently delivering great coffee to homes since 1972. That\u2019s 45 years of proven performance with thousands of loyal customers.
