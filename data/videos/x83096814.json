    "description": "One of the keys to great tasting coffee is using freshly ground beans. Grinding coffee beans right before brewing keeps your coffee's rich, full-bodied flavor intact. With the Single Serve Grind and Brew Coffeemaker, you can grind your favorite beans and brew a fantastic cup, all in one appliance. \n\nBrew up to 16 ounces of coffee in a snap. Simply fill the water reservoir, add whole beans to the bean chamber, and push the Grind brew button. The coffee maker will automatically grind the beans and dispense them into the filter, no scooping needed. \n\nOr if you choose, you can also brew pre-ground coffee, by adding the grounds to the filter and selecting the Brew button to bypass the grinding process. The adjustable cup rest fits a standard cup or a travel mug. And the duel spout can deliver two streams of coffee to two cups at the same time. \n\nAn automatic rinse feature cleans out the bean chamber to prevent clogging. You're morning cup will be fresher and easier when you make the Single Serve Grind and Brew Coffeemaker a part of your daily routine. Now that's good thinking.",
